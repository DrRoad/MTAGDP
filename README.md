Modelled Territorial Authority Gross Domestic Product for New Zealand

This repository hosts a snapshot of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's code repository used to create modelled estimates of Territorial Authority Gross Domestic Product for New Zealand.

The code will not run end to end because of dependencies on the MBIE environment.  It is presented here for transparency reasons and to help methodological debate, if it arises.  The Ministry does not regard these estimates as an end state, and there is an active project to improve them further, by making aggregate figures available in a more timely fashion and numerous improvements to issues such as the 'commuter correction' for allocating residence-based earnings to place of production.

The data, full methodology, and interactive web app for exploring the data are available from http://www.mbie.govt.nz.

Caveats and disclaimers:

* These estimates are at a more detailed level of granularity than available in the Statistics New Zealand official Tier 1 regional GDP series. They are experimental in nature and should be used with caution.	The data are modelled and produced by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) (not by Statistics New Zealand), according to the methods outlined in [link to come].
* These estimates are not a Tier 1 statistic and have been created by MBIE for research purposes. While various Statistics New Zealand collections form the source data, Statistics New Zealand will not be held accountable for any error, inaccurate findings or interpretation within the publication.
* One of the sources used in the modelling is a customised dataset, with confidentiality applied, provided by Statistics New Zealand. Access to that data was provided to MBIE by Statistics New Zealand under conditions designed to give effect to the security and confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act 1975.
* MBIE is not responsible for the results of any actions taken on the basis of this information.
